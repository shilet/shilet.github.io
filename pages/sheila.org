  high-tech company that develops control and measurement systems for
  inspection, process monitoring and quality control in the container
  glass industry. As senior software developer I am responsible for
  research and development of new products, as well as training of
  consultants and advanced customer support.
- 2006 - 2007: Research at the department of Radiology, University
  Medical Centre Groningen. Several small projects on cardiac imaging
  (detection of stenosis, vessel segmentation) and breast cancer
  (develop statistical models to estimate the breast cancer risk).
- 2001 - 2005: Ph.D. at the University Medical Centre Nijmegen under
  supervision of
  [[http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Person?name=Nico_Karssemeijer][prof.dr.ir. N. Karssemeijer]] and [[http://www.mbfys.ru.nl/~stan/][prof.dr.  C.C.A.M. Gielen]] . I have developed intelligent and efficient
  software for the detection and classification of breast tumours on
  mammograms. The project was done in cooperation with R2, and the
  software is implemented in the clinically used R2 image checker for
  'computer aided diagnosis'.
- 2000 - 2001: Project at the department of Electrical Engineering,
  [[https://www.utwente.nl/en/][Twente University]] , under supervision
  of prof.dr. C. Slump. I have worked on the development of software for

* Thesis

[[/images/breast.jpg]]




To download my thesis `Analysis of Temporal Mammogram Pairs to Detect
and Characterise Mass Lesions', which I finished in 2006, press:
[[/files/STimpThesis.pdf][thesis.pdf]].

The cover is a fractal breast image and was made by
[[http://www.deborah.ws/%22][Deborah Lee Soltesz]] .

Fractals are patterns that repeat themselves at every scale. Fractals
are mathematical structures, but can also be found in nature. There are
many nice websites about fractals (for instance
[[http://fractalfoundation.org/][fractalfoundation]], where you can find
beautiful pictures as well as software to explore fractals yourself).

For my breast cancer research I used fractals to detect tumours in
mammograms.

For the birth of the twins a had the following birth card with the
so-called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve][/images/twin dragon
fractal]] .
